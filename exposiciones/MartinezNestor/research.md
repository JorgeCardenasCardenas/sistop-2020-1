Self-driving cars might soon will have to make ethical judgments on their own; however, settling a universal moral code for the vehicles could be a hard task. The largest survey of machine ethics finds that the moral principles that guide a driver's decicions vary by country and according to Iyad Rahwan, computer scientist at MIT, *"[...] there are no universal rules"* for setting an ethic guide.

Online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries. 

1. Global moral preferences: 
2. Document individual variations in preferences: 
3. Report cross cultural ethical variation (three major clusters of countries): 
4. These differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits: 

Autonomous vehicles will cruise our roads soon, necessitating agreement on the principles that should apply when life-threatening dilemmas emerge.
